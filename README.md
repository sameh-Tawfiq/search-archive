The program will ask you to type a URL and a date. Then, it asks the Wayback
Machine if it has a copy of that website around that date. If it found one, it returns the
information to this Python program, which prints the URL and displays it in your
web browser. The point is to show how Python handles a variety of tasksâ€”get your
typed input, communicate across the internet to a website, get back some content,
extract a URL from it, and convince your web browser to display that URL.
